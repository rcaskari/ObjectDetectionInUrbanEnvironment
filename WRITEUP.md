### Project overview
This section should contain a brief description of the project and what we are trying to achieve. Why is object detection such an important component of self driving car systems?

The goal of this 1st project is to demonstrate how the basics of the machine learning workflow come together to help a user tackle real world problems. Generally, to test fundamentals around data exploration, data pipelines, and creating models. More specfically, we'll be starting with tensorflow records from the waymo dataset and from data points outlined in those records we'll be able to outline respective bounding boxes around images to then pass through a model built using the TensorFlow object detection API.

Object detection is at the core of self-driving car systems - a vehicle system needs to know what surrounds it in an environement as that will dicate its actions in the world. 

### Set up
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.
#### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Training
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

#### Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
